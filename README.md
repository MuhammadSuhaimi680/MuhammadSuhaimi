I am currently a third-year Bachelor of Science (BSc) student in Computer Science, majoring in Software Engineering at the University of Science, Malaysia (USM). I also hold a Diploma in Mechatronics Engineering from Ungku Omar Polytechnic (PUO) which has provided me with a solid foundation in engineering principles and interdisciplinary problem-solving.

I have experience in business development, software development, computer vision, and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, gained under the supervision of the Centre for Innovation & Consultants (CIC) at the University of Science, Malaysia (USM) during a university start-up accelerator program. I am also experienced in designing and developing robots, utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) framework and LabVIEW, which involves embedded systems such as sensor integration, electronic components, and programming robots using microcontrollers. My expertise also extends to areas related to mechanical, electrical, and electronic components.

My interests are not limited to the fields of computer science or engineering area. I also aspire to embark on a journey in the tech start-up business. Additionally, I am actively involved in stock market investments both in the Malaysian market and globally, with a strong understanding of fundamental and technical analysis, particularly in the context of stock market investment strategies and investment perspectives.
